# Pipe Fix.ing

# IN-DEVELOPMENT VERSION. PLEASE SEE http://gasleaks.info FOR THE CURRENT VERSION.

National Grid has discovered hundreds of gas leaks in Acton, in the gas pipes they laid themselves. Many have been left unfixed for years, and they continue to be severe issues. Furthermore, some leaks have mysteriously disappeared, and are not found on National Grid’s later datasets.

Independent researchers such as Bob Ackley, are working to uncover this problem. Participating in a 2016 study by the Home Energy Efficiency Team and the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, Ackley measured far more gas leaks than National Grid in a small 15-mile sample area, including some that release methane in an area spanning over 5000 square feet.

Natural gas, also known as methane, that is present in the soil can suffocate trees by removing oxygen and play a major role in climate change. Over 20 years, a molecule of methane is 81 times more effective than carbon dioxide at warming our planet.

So, combining HEET and MAPC’s data and NGRID’s own reports, we get a more complete view of the hidden leaks in Acton, so that utilities and the government can coordinate to fix them.
