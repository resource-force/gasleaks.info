# 2018 Gas Leak Update — Details

## Table 3: Unmappable Leaks

These “unmappable” leaks are those for which location information from NGRID was not precise enough to permit plotting at www.gasleaks.info. As of 2017, including all previous data sets, there were 6 “unmappable” leaks. Several of these leaks appeared again in the 2018 data set, along with two new leaks without enough precise information to map: a pole at Arlington Street and a pole at Francine Road.

## Info Regarding 8 High Street

Gas Safety recorded 2 leaks at 8 High Street with the same leak number. 8 High Street shows up in merged data as an SEI, since Gas Safety detected two leaks there, although National Grid fixed a leak at 8 High Street. It is thus unclear if there should be an SEI there.

- 8.5.19 Kevin wrote to Bob Ackley to ask about this.
- 8.8 Bob Ackley replied: “Good question. There were two leaks at 8 High Street and I could not determine which leak or both were listed by the NGRID number. If the gas main was replaced then both leaks were eliminated. If NGRID did a repair, then there should be street opening permits. I suggest checking with Corey York on the street opening permits and the possibility that the main was replaced.”
