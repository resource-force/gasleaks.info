# Acton Gas Leak Areas Map

New information has recently come to light that there are a large number of natural gas leaks in National Grid pipelines in Acton. These leaks **contribute to global climate change, can kill street trees and can harm human health**. They are also expensive, as the cost of this lost gas is passed on to customers. You may not be able to see gas leaking into the air, but the effects of it are undeniably harmful. We encourage you to use this map to educate yourself on the distribution of gas leaks in Acton.

## The Map

Click on each map location for detail. Info is subject to change, as leaks may have developed or been repaired since the most recent data received.

Gas leak locations are recorded as street addresses; please note that the **leak area is near the pipeline at the street, not at the residence itself** (although Google Maps may place pins at a residence).

If you smell gas, please [contact National Grid](https://www.nationalgridus.com/MA-Home/Safety/Report-a-gas-emergency). Leaks and repairs are the responsibility of National Grid (not the Town of Acton).

## Details

To create this map, we combined leaks from the following datasets:

1. NGRID's Acton Repaired 2016 (courtesy of HEET).
2. NGRID's Acton Unrepaired 2016 (courtesy of HEET).
3. NGRID's Acton Repaired from 2017-03-01 to 2017-09-05 (courtesy of Corey York).
4. MAPC-HEET's 15-mile study, created in 2016 via a federal grant.
5. NGRID's leaks that were on their 2014 dataset, but gone on the 2015 set: labeled "missing" on the map (courtesy of HEET).

Combining HEET and MAPC’s independent data and NGRID’s own reports, we get a more complete view of Acton's hidden leaks.

For example, there are several places where a National Grid leak overlaps with one from the independent study, but also many independently-discovered leaks with no corresponding National Grid report. The independent study also reports five leak areas that extend over more than 5,000 square feet each, clustered on Prospect Street.

## Data Sources

All data sources, spreadsheets, and information are publicly available from [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxvhjeQ0TJG_dTRHQzdXMWMwZ2M).

The map was built from [the spreadsheet "Universal List of Gas Leak Areas"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e88W9qygYjCi8ZELTvjaY0qYX0ZT344TDZgfmY6_Od4/edit?usp=sharing), which is a unified compilation of [each data set's source spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4AE4ExiJ9zua2gtaDVTdEpOYmc).

## Future

There are several inconsistencies in our current data sets (such as leaks without a street number and leaks that are reported as both repaired and unrepaired in the same year) that we would like to clarify and address.

Furthermore, while the MAPC-HEET study only covered around fifteen miles of Acton, the Acton Board of Selectmen is planning to sponsor a more comprehensive independent study of the entirety of Acton. Once the results are published, we would like to add them to the map.

## Contributors

This map has been created by members of the Acton-Boxborough Resource Force, working to educate our community on the issue of gas leaks and moving towards a sustainable future. See the [About page](about) for more details.
