# About

The map and this site, {{ site.title }}, were created by Kevin Liu and Kunal Sharda for the Acton-Boxborough Regional High School Resource Force club. However, the majority of the work was done by others. We are extemely grateful to:

- National Grid, which publicly provide gas leak data sets, available via request to the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities as required by [Massachusetts Bill H. 4164](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/188/House/H4164).
- The Metropolitan Area Planning Committee (MAPC) and the Home Energy Efficiency Team (HEET), for conducting the fifteen-mile survey of Acton and 14 other towns. More information is available [via Green Acton](https://greenacton.org/2017/02/16/heetmapc-gas-leaks-study/).
- Corey York, Town Engineer and Director of Public Works, for providing data on repaired leaks from March 1, 2017, to September 5, 2017.
- Kate Crosby, our club advisor and Energy Manager of the Acton-Boxborough Regional School District, for getting the data sets and showing us the danger of Acton's hidden gas leaks.
