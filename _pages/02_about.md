# About

* The map and this site were created by Kevin Liu and Kunal Sharda for the Resource Force student team at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. Much of the work was contributed by others. We are extremely grateful to:
* Our fellow Resource Force student team members and Kate Crosby, our advisor and ABRSD Energy Manager, for the work we’ve done together on how to present information on Acton’s gas leaks accurately and effectively.
* The [Home Energy Efficiency Team (HEET)](https://www.heetma.org/squeaky-leak/natural-gas-leaks-maps/) and [Metropolitan Area Planning Committee (MAPC)](https://www.mapc.org/) for early information about the size of Acton’s gas leaks from the independent gas leak survey in the [Fixing Our Pipes](http://fixourpipes.org/) study.
* The Acton Board of Selectmen for leadership in commissioning an independent town-wide survey of gas leaks.
* Corey York, Acton Town Engineer and Director of Public Works, for his generous communication with us and access to 2017 data.
* National Grid for making its gas leak datasets publicly available via request to the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities as described in [Massachusetts Bill H. 4164](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/188/House/H4164).
